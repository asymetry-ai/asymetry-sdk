**Key Features**
- Automatic instrumentation of OpenAI and Anthropic APIs.
- Rich span payloads for detailed telemetry analysis.
- Custom tracing hooks for Python functions using OpenTelemetry.
- A resilient exporter to maintain app responsiveness.
- Compatibility with Python 3.13+ and Asymetry API key required.

**Installation and Usage**
